# Visual Analyzer

## Project Description

Visual Analyzer is a powerful Python-based tool for advanced image and video analysis. It provides a comprehensive suite of features for color correction, color zone analysis, image alignment, and symmetry analysis. The tool is designed to be project-based, allowing users to manage different analysis tasks with specific configurations and reference materials. The application is accessible through a Tkinter-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

## Core Concepts & Theory

For a deeper, university-level explanation of the core algorithms used in this project, please see the documents below:

-   **[Theory: Color Correction](./docs/THEORY_ColorCorrection.md)**: A detailed guide on the tiered patch detection system and the robust, cost-matrix-based patch matching algorithm.
-   **[Theory: Image Alignment](./docs/THEORY_Alignment.md)**: An in-depth look at the two-stage alignment process, covering both the projective geometry of ArUco markers and the contour-based methods for object alignment.
-   **[Theory: Symmetry Analysis](./docs/THEORY_Symmetry.md)**: An explanation of the geometric principles behind the reflection, rotation, translation, and glide-reflection symmetry analyses.

## Features

*   **Modular Analysis Pipeline**: Sequentially run color correction, geometric alignment, object alignment, masking, and color/symmetry analysis.
*   **Extensible Project Management**: Each analysis is configured via a project-specific `project_config.json`.
*   **Robust Color Correction**: Utilizes a tiered patch detection strategy (ArUco, OpenCV, YOLO) and robust color-matching for stable color correction.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting**: Automatically generates detailed PDF and HTML reports with plots, metadata, and visual pipeline steps.
*   **Full-Featured GUI**: A Tkinter-based GUI to manage projects, datasets, and run the entire analysis pipeline.
*   **Report History & Regeneration**: A "History & Reports" tab in the GUI to scan, view, filter, and regenerate past analysis reports from archives.
*   **Advanced Dataset Management**: Includes a "File Placer" to easily manage project assets and a training image manager with previews and delete functionality.

    ```

## Configuration

The Visual Analyzer uses a project-based configuration system. Each project is a directory in the `data/projects` folder. Use the GUI (`python src/gui.py`) to scaffold a new project via the "Create Project" tab.

### `project_config.json`

This file defines the core settings for your project. When a project is created, it is pre-filled with default paths. Paths are relative to the project's root directory.

```json
{
    "training_path": "dataset/training_images",
    "object_reference_path": "dataset/object_reference.png",
    "color_correction": {
        "reference_color_checker_path": "dataset/default_color_checker_reference.png",
        "project_specific_color_checker_path": "dataset/project_color_checker.png"
    },
    "geometrical_alignment": {
        "reference_path": "dataset/default_geometric_align_reference.png",
        "marker_map": {},
        "output_size": [
            1000,
            1000
        ]
    },
    "masking": {
        "drawing_layers": {
            "1": "dataset/drawing_layers/layer1.png",
            "2": "dataset/drawing_layers/layer2.png",
            "3": "dataset/drawing_layers/layer3.png"
        }
    }
}
```

*   `training_path`: Path to the directory of images for calculating the target color range.
*   `object_reference_path`: Path to the reference image for object alignment.
*   `color_correction`: Object containing paths for color correction.
    *   `reference_color_checker_path`: Path to the ideal, canonical color checker image (auto-generated).
    *   `project_specific_color_checker_path`: Path to a photo of the color checker taken in the project's specific lighting. **You must provide this file.**
*   `geometrical_alignment`: Object for ArUco-based alignment settings.
*   `masking`: Object containing paths to drawing layers for masking.

### `dataset_item_processing_config.json`

This file defines how sample images in the `training_path` are processed for color range calculation. You can edit this manually or use the interactive GUI (`python src/gui.py` -> "Manage Dataset" tab).

```json
{
    "image_configs": [
        {
            "filename": "sample1.png",
            "method": "full_average"
        },
        {
            "filename": "sample2.png",
            "method": "points",
            "points": [
                {"x": 100, "y": 150, "radius": 7}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Usage

### Launching the Application

The application can be launched either via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or through the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

*   **GUI:** To start the GUI, run `src/gui.py`.
    ```bash
    python src/gui.py
    ```
    The GUI provides an intuitive way to create projects, manage reference files, and configure analysis options.

*   **CLI:** To run the analysis directly from the command line, provide the necessary arguments to `main.py`:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py --project <project_name> --image <path_to_image> [options]
    ```
