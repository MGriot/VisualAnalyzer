# Visual Analyzer - GUI Usage Guide

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of all features available in the main Visual Analyzer GUI, which is the recommended way to interact with the tool.

To launch the application, run:
```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Run the gui module (add --debug to see all options)
python -m src.gui --debug
```

## Main Tabs

The GUI is organized into four main tabs:

1.  **Run Analysis**: The main screen for configuring and executing a single analysis run.
2.  **History & Reports**: A powerful tool for viewing past analyses and regenerating reports.
3.  **Create Project**: A simple utility to scaffold a new project directory.
4.  **Manage Dataset**: Tools for managing project files and defining color sample points.

## 1. Run Analysis Tab

This is the primary tab for running the analysis pipeline on a single image.

### Configuration

1.  **Project Name**: Select the project you are working on. The dropdown is populated from the folders in `data/projects/`.
2.  **Select Image**: Click to choose the image file you want to analyze.
3.  **Part Number & Thickness**: These fields are automatically filled by parsing the filename of the selected image. You can manually edit them to override the values for the analysis and report.
4.  **Select Color Checker**: If using Color Alignment, you must select the image of the color checker taken under the same lighting conditions as your sample image.

### Analysis Steps & Options

If you run the GUI in `--debug` mode, a comprehensive set of options appears, allowing you to enable or disable every step of the pipeline (e.g., Color Alignment, Masking, Symmetry Analysis) and configure their parameters.

### Running the Analysis

1.  Click **"Run Analysis"**.
2.  A popup will confirm the analysis is starting.
3.  Once the image processing is complete, a **"Save As..."** dialog will appear, allowing you to choose where to save the final PDF report.
4.  If running in debug mode, you will then be asked if you want a "Normal" or full "Debug" report.

## 2. History & Reports Tab

This tab allows you to find, filter, and regenerate reports from all past analyses.

### Features

1.  **Scan for Reports**: Click this button to scan the entire `output/` directory for analysis archives (`.gri` files). The table will be populated with the findings.
2.  **Filterable Table**: The main view is a table showing key metadata from each analysis. You can filter the results in real-time by typing into the entry boxes at the top of each column.
3.  **Sorting**: Click any column header to sort the results by that column.
4.  **Report Regeneration**:
    *   Select a single row in the table.
    *   The **"Recreate Selected Report"** button will become active.
    *   Click it, and a "Save As..." dialog will appear, allowing you to save a new copy of the PDF report.
    *   If you are in debug mode, you can also choose to regenerate as a "Normal" or "Debug" report.

## 3. Create Project Tab

This provides a simple form to create a new, empty project with the correct folder structure and default configuration files in the `data/projects/` directory.

---

## 4. Manage Dataset Tab

This tab contains tools to help set up your project's assets.

1.  **Launch Point Selector**: Opens a dedicated GUI for selecting specific points on your training images to define the target color space. This is an alternative to using the entire image for color calculation.
2.  **Setup Project Files**: Opens the **Project File Placer** GUI.

### Project File Placer Enhancements

The File Placer helps you copy required files (like reference images and drawing layers) into the correct locations. It has been enhanced with a **Training Image Manager**:

*   **Add Images**: Select one or more training images from anywhere on your computer to copy them into the project.
*   **Preview**: See thumbnails of all training images currently in the project.
*   **Delete**: A "Delete" button next to each image allows for easy removal.
